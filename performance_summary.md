# MySQL Query Performance Optimization Results

## Summary of Performance Improvements

This document summarizes the dramatic performance improvements achieved by optimizing our MySQL queries through proper indexing and query structure.

## Test Environment

- Database: MySQL 
- Table: `oauth_tokens` with approximately 5 million rows
- Test queries: Four core query patterns commonly used in our application

## Performance Comparison (in milliseconds)

| Query Type                       | Without Indexes | With Indexes | Improvement Factor | Improvement % |
|----------------------------------|----------------:|-------------:|-------------------:|-------------:|
| Basic equality (user_id = ?)     | 2,428.67 ms     | 41.47 ms     | 58.6x             | 98.3%        |
| IN clause (user_id IN ?)         | 10,753.37 ms    | 127.47 ms    | 84.4x             | 98.8%        |
| BETWEEN (user_id BETWEEN ? AND ?) | 2,885.58 ms    | 178.55 ms    | 16.2x             | 93.8%        |
| AND condition (user_id = ? AND token_type = ?) | 1,524.66 ms | 6.78 ms | 224.9x      | 99.6%        |

## Key Optimizations Applied

1. **Created covering indexes** that include all columns needed by the query
   - This eliminates table lookups, which are expensive I/O operations
   - Particularly effective for queries that select only a few columns

2. **Used optimized column selection**
   - Changed `SELECT *` to specific columns, reducing network transfer and memory usage

3. **Enabled MySQL optimizer settings**
   - Multi-Range Read (MRR) for better disk access patterns
   - Batch Key Access for faster joins
   - Index condition pushdown for better filtering

## Query Execution Plan Insights

- The optimized queries are now using the indexes effectively with "Using index" appearing in the execution plan
- The BETWEEN query changed from a full table scan to a range scan, dramatically improving performance
- The AND condition query now uses a composite index effectively, resulting in a 99.6% reduction in execution time

## Recommendations for Future Query Writing

1. Always create indexes that match your query patterns
2. Select only the columns you need rather than using `SELECT *`
3. For queries with multiple conditions, create composite indexes that match the condition order
4. For range queries (BETWEEN, >, <), put the range column last in a composite index
5. Monitor query performance regularly and adjust indexes as usage patterns change

## Conclusion

Proper MySQL indexing and query optimization has resulted in performance improvements ranging from 16x to 225x faster. This translates to better user experience, lower resource usage, and ability to handle larger datasets.
